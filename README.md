# AutoGluon Doc Utils

This repo is intended to store doc artifacts for [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html),
such as the [cheat-sheets](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/cheatsheet.html).

## Editing the cheat-sheet .key files

When editing the .key files in Keynote to create or update a cheat sheet, it is important to use the correct fonts.
Currently, we use custom fonts that must be downloaded by
going to the below links and clicking 'Download family' in the top right.

1. [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
2. [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)

Once downloaded, follow [this guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/install-and-validate-fonts-fntbk1000/mac)
to install the fonts.

Once this is completed, when exporting a .key file to PDF on your system,
it should appear identical to the PDF cached in this repo.
If it does not, then the fonts may not be properly installed.

To make the JPEG file, open the PDF and export to JPEG, specify quality to best with 300 pixels/inch.
